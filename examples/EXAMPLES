Some examples on the usage of libdbase:

0) Plug in the detector in an available USB-port
   (actually, example1 works with many digibases)

Example 1)
	Open connection to connected dbase(s) and 
	print status of device, then make a clean exit.
   
	see: src/example1.c

Example 2)
	Open connection to dbase, enable HV and start detector,
	print a couple of spectra and make a clean exit.

	see: src/example2.c

Example 3)
	Open connection, enable HV, set in list-mode
	and measure for 10s in list mode at 20Hz, printing
	to stdout. 
	Then reset into PHA mode and make a clean exit.

Compile and run the examples using:
$ make (if you havn't already compiled libdbase)
$ sudo ./example1
$ sudo ./example2
$ sudo ./example3
