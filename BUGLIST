libdbase:
#1 dbase_read(): 
   internal buffer copied the wrong number of bytes SOLVED 12-02-13.
#2 dbase_write_status(): 
   for big endian machines. SOLVED.
#3 Live/Real time preset not working. SOLVED 12-02-24
#4 libdbase_read_lm_packets(): 
   Wrong length of buffer send to device. SOLVED 12-02-25.
#5 MAC users may experience lost connection with usb-device,
   this seems to be due to the use of sleep(), c.f. src/example2-3.c.
   The issue can be avoided by using the internal clock live/real time
   the device itself. Start a msmt and reconnect whenever you want some info
   from the detector.

dbase:
#1 -name Create directory (serial no) fails (unless -save was run first?) SOLVED 11-06-26
